# Variables

'''
Let's think of a variable as a container, for example, you want to store a bunch of fruits, you label certain number of containers according to how you want to store the fruits, i.e. you can store the fruits in category of names, colors or even size.
Picking names as an example, you lebel the containers with different names and store each fruit in a container matching its name.
